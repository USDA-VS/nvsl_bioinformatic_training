# NVSL Bioinformatics Training

## Description:
The NVSL Bioinformatics Workshop will feature training on command-line bioinformatic tools, processes, and resources routinely used at NVSL for diagnostic testing. The training will provide an overview, enabling participants to make informed decisions by learning the fundamental steps involved in bioinformatic analyses and exploring the creative options available when working with these tools.

## Objectives:
- Understand the basics and key points when starting to work on the command line.
- Familiarize yourself with command-line bioinformatics.
- Recognize the options available when dealing with large datasets.
- Gain awareness of the variety of tools and processes available.

## Target Audience:
This training is designed for individuals interested in learning and performing basic bioinformatic processes at the command line for bacterial and viral diagnostics. It serves as an introductory course for getting started with bioinformatic concepts and tools, covering essential command-line processes for data management and exploring tools for quality assessment, identification, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, and genotyping of samples.

## Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with Linux and at least some command-line experience.
- Access to a Linux environment:
  - Ubuntu/CentOS
  - macOS
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- VS Code.
- Enthusiasm for working on the command line.

Note: Please ensure you meet the prerequisites before attending the training.
